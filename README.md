# üìò Discrete_Math_1_PTIT - To√°n r·ªùi r·∫°c 1 (PTIT)

## üßæ Introduction

This repository contains a complete collection of my programming solutions related to the **Discrete Mathematics 1** course at the **Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT)**.

All code is written in **C++**, covering key concepts in logic, set theory, relations, functions, mathematical induction, and combinatorics. The goal is to create a comprehensive reference for students, self-learners, and those reviewing for exams.
